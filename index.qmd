## Overview

`data_validation` is a lightweight Python package for defining, validating, and
comparing **data contracts** for tabular datasets. A data contract captures
assumptions about a dataset’s schema, data types, missingness, numeric ranges,
and categorical values.

The package supports a simple, reproducible workflow:

1. Infer a contract from a reference dataset  
2. Validate new data against the contract  
3. Compare contracts to detect schema or distribution drift  
4. Summarize validation failures for debugging and CI use

## Installation

Install the package from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI_524_G26_Data_Validation.git
cd DSCI_524_G26_Data_Validation
pip install -e .
```

## Example Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
from data_validation import (
    infer_contract,
    validate_contract,
    compare_contracts,
    summarize_violations,
    validate_and_fail,
)

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "age": [25, 40, 35],
    "salary": [50000, 75000, 62000],
    "department": ["HR", "Engineering", "HR"]
})
```

### Inferring a contract

```python
contract = infer_contract(df)
```
This infers expected column types, missingness constraints, numeric ranges,
and categorical domains from the data.

### Validating data 

```python
result = validate_contract(df, contract)
result.passed
```
This checks whether the data conforms to the contract and returns a structured
validation result containing errors and warnings.

### Comparing Contracts

```python
new_contract = infer_contract(df)
drift_report = compare_contracts(contract, new_contract)
```
This identifies schema or distribution drift between two data contracts.

### Summarizing violations 

```python
summary = summarize_violations(result)
summary
```
This produces a concise summary of the most important validation failures.
